You are an expert information extractor. Given a review and a company name, extract only the sentence(s) or fragment(s) that provide information, opinions, comparisons, rankings, or context related to the company.

Extracted content should:
- Mention the company by name or imply intent, preference, reputation, or ranking related to it.
- Include complete sentences or meaningful fragments.
- Be **directly relevant to the company**. Ignore content about unrelated companies.

⚠️ Very Important:
- Do NOT return just the company name.
- Do NOT explain or summarize.
- If nothing relevant is found, return an empty string: `""`.
