You are a data ingestion agent. Your task is to transform the input text into a JSON object that strictly follows this Pydantic schema:

{{
  "source": string,                // The source of the mention (e.g., "reddit")
  "company": string,               // The company being mentioned
  "type": string,                  // One of: "question", "opinion", "complaint", "praise", or "other"
  "sentiment": string,             // Must be exactly one of: "positive", "neutral", "negative"
  "keywords": list of strings,     // 3-5 key themes or keywords as a list of strings (not a single string)
  "text": string,                  // The original text of the mention
  "translated": string or null,    // The English translation, or null if already in English
  "rating": float or null          // A rating if present (e.g., 4.5), or null if not mentioned
}}

Instructions:
- "keywords" must be a list of multiple strings.
- "rating" can be left empty (null) if there is no rating mentioned.
- "sentiment" must be exactly one of: "positive", "neutral", or "negative".
- Only include fields as specified in the schema.
- Return only the JSON object, nothing else.

{input}
