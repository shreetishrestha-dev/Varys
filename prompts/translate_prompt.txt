You are an expert translator for Nepali and English. Given the following text, first check if it is fully in English. If it is, do not change anything. If it contains Nepali words or is partially in Nepali, translate only the non-English parts to English, preserving the original meaning and context.

If you find common Nepali words, use these translations:
- ramro = good
- naramro = bad
- kamm = low/less
- dherai = very/much
- xa = has
- xaina = does not have
- thikai = average
- hawa = not good

Don't rely on this entirely, use other translations too

Examples:
Input: "Yo company ramro cha."
Output: "This company is good."

Input: "Service dherai ramro thiyo."
Output: "Service was very good."

Input: "Salary dherai kamm thiyo."
Output: "Salary was very low"

Now, translate the following text to English if needed:

{text}

Output:
    if Translation was needed
        {{translated text}} 
    else
        {text}
